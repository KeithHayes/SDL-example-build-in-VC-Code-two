# SDL-example-build-in-VC-Code
A C++ gcc build with SDL on Visual Studio Code using Cmake.  A simple program showing a picture on the screen which builds and debugs.

This program is here as a simple template.  Clicking the 'x' removes the pic.

My system runs Linux Mint.  This is a SDL hello world type project which will build on Mint 20.2 or Ubuntu 20.04 as is.

I added 3 plugins to Visual Studio Code : 'C/C++ Makefile Project' , 'C/C++ Extension Pack' and plain 'C/C++' to make using CMake easy.

The inspiration for this is example 7.
